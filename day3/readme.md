use the dot notation to add a new property called "location" and set it to your own location.
Then, use the square bracket notation to update the value of the "email" property to your own email address.
Next, create a nested object called "family" with the following properties:

 JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() methods. Use console.log() to display both the original and cloned objects in the console.

use the Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries() methods to display the keys, values, and key-value pairs of the "person" object in the console.
